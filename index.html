                        <p>For the sake of this exercise let&#39;s assume the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Properties, Tenancies and Tenants are new custom models in the system. Create the
                                appropriate models, views ans access rights.</li>
                            <li>Tenants are res.partner records, where only additional fields need to be added. Once
                                those fields are added to the python model, also add them to the existing partner form
                                view</li>
                            <li>Tenancies are created in draft mode by default. They should have a button that changes
                                their state to &#39;Active&#39; that can only be used if the Start Date and End Date are
                                both defined correctly (Date End &gt; Date Start)</li>
                            <li>For a tenancy to be terminated, we need to create a new scheduled action that will check
                                every day whether a tenancy has reached its end date or not. For this, we need to create
                                a new ir.cron record.</li>
                        </ul>
