## Notes

For the sake of this exercise let's assume the following:

-   Properties, Tenancies and Tenants are new custom models in the system. Create the appropriate models, views ans access rights.
-   Tenants are res.partner records, where only additional fields need to be added. Once those fields are added to the python model, also add them to the existing partner form view
-   Tenancies are created in draft mode by default. They should have a button that changes their state to 'Active' that can only be used if the Start Date and End Date are both defined correctly (Date End > Date Start)
-   For a tenancy to be terminated, we need to create a new scheduled action that will check every day whether a tenancy has reached its end date or not. For this, we need to create a new ir.cron record.
-   Make the new views & actions accessible via a new menu item that should read: Realty Management
